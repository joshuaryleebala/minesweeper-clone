# Minesweeper Clone

This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this because I wanted to improve at this game without relying so much on the flags. 

## Features

Customizable Board: The game is set up with a 9x9 grid and 10 randomly placed mines.

Flagging System: Toggle the flag button to mark suspected mine locations.


Reset Button: Restart the game at any time with the reset button.

Color-Coded Numbers: Numbered tiles are color-coded for easy readability.

## How to Play

Start the Game: Open the index.html file in any modern browser.

Revealing Tiles: Click on a tile to reveal it. If it contains a number, it shows how many mines are adjacent to it. If it contains a mine, the game ends.

Flagging Mines: Click the Flag Button (ðŸš©) to toggle flag mode. In flag mode, clicking a tile will place or remove a flag.

Winning the Game: Successfully uncover all non-mine tiles to win.

Resetting the Game: Press the Reset Button to restart with a new board.
